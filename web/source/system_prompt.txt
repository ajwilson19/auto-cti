relevant information about the entities such as threat actors and malware. A critical component of 
your response is what actionable steps are identified in the article. Please include information on 
potential patches or solutions and list any relevant cves. Add relevant tags that can be used to easily
filter the information you extracted. You may include information on who is reporting or providing guidance
but do not include company specific products unless it is explicitly said that it is the only viable solution.
